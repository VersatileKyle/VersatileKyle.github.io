<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Kyle A Stewart and I'm a computer science major and photographer at the University of Colorado, Boulder! I'm currently finishing my sophomore year and finishing some of my first few upper division computer science classes. In addition, I'm finishing my first photography class and that has sparked my interest for photography more than ever! This website is a combination of both of my biggest interests. I've never written a website before, but I needed to find a unique way to present my photography portfolio so hear we are. In my free time I tend to spend as much time outside as possible if I'm not doing homeowrk or tinkering with other tech related tasks. Being an adrenaline junky, I love to ski, white water kayak, and have been both skydiving and bungee jumping!</p>
<h2>Artist Statement:</h2>
<p>With photography, I am conveying stories through my pictures. The best way I think I can explain it is similar to the style of vlogging. Some people record their days and post them online to show the world what they are up to, but for me I’m trying to do that with just pictures. As I learn more about photography and how to express what I want through my photos, I am sharing my adventures, goals, and struggles through my work. This can branch from simple shots of scenery I find beautiful in a day in my life or things as extreme as action shots of me doing a backflip. Photography for me will be a digital (maybe sometimes physical) story of my life in still form instead of video. I’m making this work by actively practicing my technique, researching new things on my own, and getting inspired by other creators. Even though I’m pursuing the route of telling my story through pictures, I really enjoy watching people’s vlog videos of their daily life as inspiration. I find myself pausing the videos and thinking “how could I represent the past minute of film in just a series of photographs?” I am motivated to document and share my experiences with those in my life who care enough to watch me do whatever it is I may do. Succeed, struggle, and anything in between. </p>
